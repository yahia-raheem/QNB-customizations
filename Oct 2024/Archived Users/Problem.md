# Description
The client wanted to set the profile status of users with status `archive` to `enable` automatically once they're back from vacation or maternity leave etc.

# Context
This should be the default behaviour since the system should be in sync with LDAP, but is not the case currently as the LDAP integration is not present on the production environment
